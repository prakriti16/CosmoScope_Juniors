The Random Forest classifier is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. 

Random subspace selection: The algorithm randomly selects a subset of features from the input dataset. This random subspace selection helps to introduce diversity among the decision trees.

Bootstrapped sampling: For each decision tree in the ensemble, a random sample of the training data is taken with replacement. 

Building decision trees: Each decision tree is constructed using the bootstrapped sample and the selected subset of features. The decision tree is built by recursively splitting the data based on feature values, aiming to maximize information gain at each split.

Voting for predictions: Once all the decision trees are built, predictions are made by each tree individually. For classification tasks, each tree assigns a class label to the input instance. The final prediction is determined through majority voting, where the class with the most votes across all trees is selected.

The Random Forest algorithm combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to make a final prediction, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness compared to individual decision trees. It can handle both classification and regression tasks and is widely used for various machine learning applications.
